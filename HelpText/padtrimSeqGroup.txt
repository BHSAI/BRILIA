padtrimSeqGroup will trim and pad sequences within a group such that they
are all the same length. This is required to ensure phylogeny trees are
constructed correctly and conformGeneGroup works.

  [VDJdata, BadVDJdata] = padtrimSeqGroup(VDJdata, VDJheader, GroupBy, KeepMode, BasedOn);

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    GroupBy ['grpnum', 'cdr3length']: Will group sequence by group number
      or CDR3 lengths first, before ensuring each group have same-length
      sequences.
    KeepMode ['mean', 'min', 'max', 'trim']: Sets how many nts left of
      CDR3start and right of CDR3end to keep, based on the mean, min, or
      max length of nts within each group. 'trim' will trim only 'x' out
      of sequences edges until a non-x letter is reached.
    BasedOn ['Seq', 'RefSeq']: determines how to trim sequences based on
      either the flanking X nts in Seq or RefSeq. Use 'RefSeq' if you
      have sequences that are longer than V and J germline genes.

  OUPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata with padded/trimmed Seq and RefSeq such that
      all groups have same-length sequences. Padding/Trimming decisions
      are "based on" either the RefSeq or Seq. Padding uses "X".
    BadVDJdata: bad entries of VDJdata that were removed due to lack of
      resolved CDR3 or info for padding/trimming.

  NOTE
    Use GroupBy 'cdr3length' before clustering by phylogeny tree, and
    then GroupBy 'grpnum' after that is done. Use KeepMode 'max' to
    retain the full sequences of all groups.

  WARNING
    This WILL remove entries in VDJdata that have no resolved CDR3start
    and CDR3end, since these sequences cannot be clustered correctly by
    same-length CDR3 regions.
