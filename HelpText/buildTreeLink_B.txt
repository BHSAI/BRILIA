DEPRACATED, replaced with calcRootedAncMap

buildTreeLink_B perform the tree linking given a defined cluster, where
the first seq is the root seq. 
The way it works is this: 
1) First seq "was" set as root, based on Template Count and Alignment Score
2) Find the "next" seq with lowest score, and link it to root.
3) Find the "next" seq with lowest score, and link it to root or other seq.
4) repeat 3 until no more linking is left.
* This linking step is indepedent of cutoff distance, as it will always
link it.
