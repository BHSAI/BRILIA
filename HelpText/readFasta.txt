readFasta will read a fasta file and return 2 cells containing the
sequence name and the sequence itself. [Not used as MATLAB has the
fastaread function]

  [Header, Sequence] = readFasta(FileName);

  [Header, Sequence] = readFasta();

  INPUT
    FileName: full file name of the fasta file. If empty, will ask user to
    select the file.

  OUTPUT
    Header: Nx1 cell of sequence header information
    Sequence: Nx1 cell of sequences
