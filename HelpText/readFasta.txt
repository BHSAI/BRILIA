readFasta will read a fasta file and return 2 cells containing the
sequence name and the sequence itself. Similar to matlab "fastaread"
but can handle files with empty line spacers.

  [Header, Seq] = readFasta();

  [Header, Seq] = readFasta(FileName);

  [Header, Seq] = readFasta(FileName, 'SeqRange', Range)

  INPUT
    FileName: file name of the fasta file. If empty, will ask user to
      select the file.
    Range: 2-element integer vector specifying first and last sequence
      to read.

  OUTPUT
    Header: Nx1 cell of sequence header information
    Seq: Nx1 cell of sequences
