conformGeneGroup will force all sequences in the same groups to have the
same Gene family and VMDNJ segment lengths as the first sequence in the
cluster, which is suppose to be close to the germline sequence.

  VDJdata = conformGeneGroup(VDJdata, VDJheader, DB)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    DB: Gene database structure (getCurrentDatabase.m)

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata where all seq in a cluster has the same
      gene annotations
