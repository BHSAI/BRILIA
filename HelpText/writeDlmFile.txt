writeDlmFile will take a cell array and convert it into a string array, 
and then save it into a delimited file. If the delimiter is the same as a
character in the string array, will automatically replace the string
character with a "|" character to ensure delimiter number is no messed up.

  writeDlmFile(CellData, OutputFile, Delimiter)

  writeDlmFile(CellData, OutputFile, Delimiter, 'append')

  INPUT
    CellData: cell array (but must not have an embeded cell in a cell);
    OutputFile: full name of the file to be saved to
    Delimiter [',' ';' '\t']: Default is ','
    'append': appends to the outfile instead of overwriting.
