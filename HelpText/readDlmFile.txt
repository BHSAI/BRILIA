readDlmFile will take a delimited file and parse it into a cell array of
strings.

  CellData = readDlmFile()

  CellData = readDlmFile(InputFile)

  CellData = readDlmFile(..., 'Delimiter', Delimiter)

  CellData = readDlmFile(..., 'LineRange', LineRange)

  INPUT
    InputFile: full name of the file to be open
    Delimiter ['' ';' ',' '\t']: Delimiter for the file. The default is
      empty '', meaning it will autodetect based on first two text lines.
      The most common delimiter symbol is assumed the true delimiter.
    LineRange [1 Inf]: 1x2 matrix of start to end lines to extract

  OUTPUT
    CellData: cell array of string data

  WARNING
    If the delimited file has improper delimiter usage, such as a single
    string field having a delimiter symbol, then will split it
    incorrectly. Also, if the number of delimited column is different
    between data rows, this will delete off the excess data entries,
    mainly because these are often OS-specific addons of ',' and to
    prevent indexing errors and rescaling of the intended data table.
