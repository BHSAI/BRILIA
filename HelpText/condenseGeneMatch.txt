condenseGeneMatch is used by findGeneMatch to reduce VDJ matches with the same
gene family, gene deletion, and alignment score. This is used to "reduce"
the number of degenerate match outputs by condensing the family names into
something like: "IGHV01: IGHV01-01*01, IGHV01-01*02". Will return all
unique gene families. Selecting which one of the degenerate solution is
best must be determined by a later function or by findGeneMatch.

  ReducedMatch = condenseGeneMatch(GeneMatch)

  INPUT
    GeneMatch: Mx6 cell matrix output from findGeneMatch
      Col1   Gene number in Xmap
      Col2   Full gene name(s)
      Col3   [LeftLength MiddleLength RighLength] of the reference gene
      Col4   [LeftLength MiddleLength RighLength] of the Seq
      Col5   [(# of matches) AlignmentScore]
      Col6   3xN character alignment results

  OUTPUT
    ReducedMatch: Mx6 cell matrix output like from findGeneMatch, but
      gene matches with the same alignment score, and Left, Middle, and
      Right lengths of the gene seq and sample seq are grouped together.

  EXAMPLE
    GeneMatch = {1 'IGHV1-01' [40 100 3] [0 100 20] [90 450] 'ACGTG';
                 2 'IGHV1-02' [40 100 3] [0 100 20] [90 450] 'ACGTG';
                 3 'IGHV1-03' [41 101 2] [0  90 30] [30 350] 'AGGTG'};
    ReducedMatch = condenseGeneMatch(GeneMatch)
    ReducedMatch = 
       [3]    'IGHV1-03'          [1x3 doub] [1x3 doub] [1x2 doub] 'AGGTG'
       [1 2]  'IGHV1-01|IGHV1-02' [1x3 doub] [1x3 doub] [1x2 doub] 'ACGTG'
