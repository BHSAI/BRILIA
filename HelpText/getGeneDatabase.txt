getGeneDatabase will get the gene database from a directory containing
IMGT fasta files, labeled as IGXX_SPECIES.fa. 

  DB = getGeneDatabase(Species)

  DB = getGeneDatabase(FolderName)

  Names = getGeneDatabase('getlist')

  INPUT
    Species: the species name, which should be the same as the folder name
      store where this m file is. mfilepath/Species/
    FolderName: Folder storing the IMGT fasta files (saved as
      IGXX_SPECIES.fa). These fasta files should have the IMGT gap ("...")
      in the V gene sequences to ensure all CDR and FWR regions are
      aligned. Use this if using IMGT's fasta files, or if users want to
      add sequences but with the gap information.

    CsvFile: comma delimited file containing the IMGT genes without gap,
      but marking where the gaps would have been and locations of CDR and
      C and F/W anchor. This file is generated everytime someone runs this
      using the FolderPath option instead.

  OUTPUT
    DB: Structure of database file containing the following fields:
      FilePath     File path of this database
      FileName     File name of this database csv file
      MapHeader    1xN cell of column names
      Vmap         V heavy gene DB
      Dmap         D heavy gene DB
      Jmap         J heavy gene DB
      Vkmap        V kappa light gene DB
      Jkmap        J kappa light gene DB
      Vlmap        V lambda light gene DB
      Jlmap        J lambda light gene DB

  NOTE on map
    Each map contains the following information:
      'Seq': gene sequence without gap
      'GeneName': gene name
      'Function': functionality f, orf, p, [f], [p]
      'Strain': mouse strain this gene was isolated from
      'EntryNum': the Nth entry number in the original fasta file
      'CDR1start': nt position where CDR1 starts
      'CDR1end': nt position where CDR1 ends
      'CDR2start': nt position where CDR2 starts
      'CDR2end': nt position where CDR2 ends
      'AnchorDist': number of nt from either 3' (or 5') side V (or J) to
        the FIRST codon nt of the conserved 104C (or the 118F/W)
      'GapInfo: location of the IMGT gaps that were removed, written as a
        string N1-M1;N2-M2;...; where N is the nt position of the
        ungapped sequence, and M is the number of gaps that follow AFTER
        this position.

  NOTE on CsvFile
    This function will always check to see if there is a csv file in the
    folder that is being summoned. If there is no csv file, it will
    generate one based on the fasta files within that folder, and use it.

  NOTE on gene locations
    This function will look in the directory ./Database_Manager/[Species]
    to load the sequences files stored in the csv file.
