calcSHMHAMdist will calculate the adjusted hamming distance that has
reduced distance if mutations agree with SHM tendencies, and increased
distance for consecutively mismatched nts.

Distance = sum(ContigMiss^2) - 0.5sum(FavoredMut) + 0.5sum(UnfavoredMut)

where ContigMiss is the length of contiguously mismatched segments,
FavoredMut is the number of mutations that agree with SHM tendencies, and
UnfavoredMut is the number of mutations that disagree with SHM tendencies.
Neutral mutations do not have a favored/unfavored distance adjustment.

The sum(ContigMiss)^2 term was added to increase the distance between
sequences with many contiguously mismatched nts that are more likely to
arise from incorrect annotations than SHMs. The idea is by increasing
distance, they are likely to be cut off from the main tree and reassigned
a new germline annotation.

  [PCdist, CPdist, HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2)

  [PCdist, CPdist, HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2,SHMtendency)

  INPUT
    Seq1: 1st sequence, assumed parent seq
    Seq2: 2nd sequence, assumed child seq
    SHMtendency: 4x4 matrix where 1 = favorable mutation, -1 =
      unfavorable mutations, 0 = no preferrence. Column are ACGT of
      starting sequence X0, rows are ACGT of ending sequence X1. Default:
      SHMtendency =    A0  C0  G0  T0
                    A1  0  -1   1  -1
                    C1  0   0  -1   0
                    G1  1  -1   0  -1
                    T1  1   1  -1   0

  OUTPUT
    PCdist: distance if Seq1 is parent and Seq2 is child.
    CPdist: distance if Seq2 is parent and Seq1 is child.
    HamDist: number of mismatched letters between Seq1 and Seq2.

  NOTE
    'X' is a wildcard match.

  EXAMPLE
    Case when C->T and A->G high preference mutations
      Seq1 = 'ACGTAT' 
      Seq2 = 'ATGTGT'
      [PCdist CPdist HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2)
         PCdist =
             1.0
         CPdist =
             1.5
         HamDist =
             2
   Case when there is a triple consec mismatch  
     Seq1 = 'ACGCTT' 
     Seq2 = 'ATTGTT'
     [PCdist CPdist HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2)
        PCdist %3^2 - 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5
            9.5
        CPdist %3^2 - 0.0 + 0.5 + 0.5
            10
        HamDist = 
            3
