calcSHMHAMdist will calculate the adjusted hamming distance that reduces
the distance if mutations agree with SHM tendencies, and increases the
distance for consecutively mismatched nts.

Distance = sum(ContigMiss^2) - 0.5sum(FavoredMut) + 0.5sum(UnfavoredMut)

ContigMiss = length of a contiguously mismatched segments
FavoredMut = number of mutations that agree with SHM tendencies
UnfavoredMut = number of mutations that disagree with SHM tendencies
Neutral mutations do not have favored/unfavored distances

The sum(ContigMiss)^2 term was added to increase the distance between
sequences with many contiguously mismatched nts that are more likely to
arise from incorrect annotations than SHMs. The idea is by increasing
distance, they are likely to be cut off from the main tree and reassigned
a new germline annotation.

  [PCdist, CPdist, HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2)

  [PCdist, CPdist, HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2, SHMtendency)

  INPUT
    Seq1: 1st sequence, assumed parent seq
    Seq2: 2nd sequence, assumed child seq
    SHMtendency: 4x4 matrix where 1 = favorable mutation, -1 =
      unfavorable mutations, 0 = no preferrence. Column are ACGT of
      starting sequence X0, rows are ACGT of ending sequence X1. Default:
      SHMtendency =    A0  C0  G0  T0
                    A1  0  -1   1  -1
                    C1  0   0  -1   0
                    G1  1  -1   0  -1
                    T1  1   1  -1   0

  OUTPUT
    PCdist: distance if Seq1 is parent and Seq2 is child.
    CPdist: distance if Seq1 is child and Seq2 is parent.
    HamDist: number of mismatched letters between Seq1 and Seq2.

  NOTE
    'X' is a wildcard match.

    Low-quality sequence reads can lead to arbitrarily high distances that
    prevent proper linking of sequences within the same lineage. Consider
    removing low-quality edges or replacing with wildcard 'X' before
    processing.

  EXAMPLE
    Case when C->T and A->G high preference mutations
      Seq1 = 'ACGTAT' 
      Seq2 = 'ATGTGT'
      [PCdist CPdist HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2)
         PCdist =
             1.0
         CPdist =
             1.5
         HamDist =
             2

   Case when there is a triple consecutive mismatch  
     Seq1 = 'ACGCTT' 
     Seq2 = 'ATTGTT'
     [PCdist CPdist HamDist] = calcSHMHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2)
        PCdist %3^2 - 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5
            9.5
        CPdist %3^2 - 0.0 + 0.5 + 0.5
            10
        HamDist = 
            3
