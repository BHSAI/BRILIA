calcSeqMutability will calculate the mutability of each nt based on
published mutability index values.

  MutVal = calcSeqMutability(Seq, mutMap)

  INPUT
    Seq: a sequences string to analyze. Ambiguous letters void
      calculations at that position.
    mutMap: hash map relating a tri-nucleotide string to its 1x3
      mutability index for the 3 nt positoins. (getMutabilityMap.m)

  OUTPUT
    MutVal: a 1xN matrix of maximum mutability indices per each Seq nt
