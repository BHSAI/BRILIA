trimMatchResults will take a binary array of sequence matches and trim
matches (1's) from the left, right, or both direction(s) until it
encounters a sequence block where 3 out of 4 are matches. Used mainly for
convolveSeq.

  MatchResults = trimMatchRestuls(MatchResults,TrimSide) 

  [MatchResults,TrimIdx] = trimMatchRestuls(MatchResults,TrimSide)

  INPUT
    MatchResults: MxN logical matrix of sequence match. 
    TrimSide ['left','right','both']: Trims this side of the MatchResults.

  OUPUT
    MatchResults: MxN logical matrix of trimmed MatchResults.
    TrimIdx: MxN logical matrix showing trimmed sites.

  NOTES 
    If you are allowing misses, such as [1 0 1], to be counted as matches,
    then fill in those allowed miss with 1's before this.

  EXAMPLE
    MatchResults(1,:) = [1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1]>0;
    MatchResults(2,:) = [1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]>0;

    TrimmedLeft = trimMatchResults(MatchResults,'left')
    TrimmedLeft =
      0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1    1    1    0    0    1
      1    1    1    0    0    1    0    1    0    1    0    1    0    1
      
    TrimmedRight = trimMatchResults(MatchResults,'right')
    TrimmedRight =
      1    1    0    0    1    0    0    0    1    1    1    0    0    0

    TrimmedBoth = trimMatchResults(MatchResults,'both')
    TrimmedBoth =
      0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1    1    1    0    0    0
