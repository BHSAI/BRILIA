findBetterD will attempt to find a better D gene match per group by trying
to increase the VDJ alignment scores and Nscores.

Nscore = (2*Ptdt-1)L^2 where Ptdt is the TDT score and L is the length of
the N region.

NOTE: This Nscore calculation differs from BRILIA paper publication
equation. It was changed to this one to reflect the difference in
probability of random NT vs TDT NT addition. The original equation, for
instance, will yield high alignment score for long sequences with random
nts. This one will yield negative values if that happens.

  VDJdata = findBetterD(VDJdata, VDJheader, DB)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    DB: Gene database structure (getCurrentDatabase.m)

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata where D genes are recomputed that maximizes
      the VDJ alignment scores and N region scores.
