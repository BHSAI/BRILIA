padtrimSeq will either pad or trim sequences so that SeqA and SeqB are the
same length, and centered about an anchoring letter. Uses 'X' for padding.

  NewSeqA = padtrimSeq(SeqA,AnchorA,LeftOpt,RightOpt)

  [NewSeqA, NewSeqB] = padtrimSeq(SeqA,SeqB,AnchorA,AnchorB,LeftOpt,RightOpt)

  [NewSeqA, NewSeqB, Aadj, Badj] = padtrimSeq(SeqA,SeqB,AnchorA,AnchorB,LeftOpt,RightOpt)

  INPUT
    SeqA/B: Sequences that you want to match with each other
    AnchorA/B: Integer position # where you want SeqA/B to be same
    LeftOpt/RightOpt: Option to set left and right lengths
      'Min'    set to same min length with respect to anchor point
      'Max'    set to same max length with respect to anchor point
      'A'      set to same length with repsect to SeqA and anchor point
      'B'      set to same length with repsect to SeqB and anchor point
      # int    set to same N number of letters left/right of anchor point

  OUTPUT
    SeqA/B: new sequences that have the same-length sequences after
      padding and/or trimming
    Aadj/Badj: 1x2 matrix showing how many letters were removed (- number)
      or added (+ number)
  
  EXAMPLE
    SeqA = 'ACGTGCGTA'
    SeqB = 'CGAGTGCATGTG'
    AnchorA = 4;
    AnchorB = 5;

    [NewSeqA, Aadj] = padtrimSeq(SeqA,AnchorA,2,7)
    NewSeqA = 
       CGTGCGTAXX
    Aadj = 
       -1    2

    [NewSeqA, NewSeqB] = padtrimSeq(SeqA,SeqB,AnchorA,AnchorB,'min','max')
    NewSeqA = 
       ACGTGCGTAXX
    NewSeqB = 
       GAGTGCATGTG

    [NewSeqA, NewSeqB, Aadj, Badj] = padtrimSeq(SeqA,SeqB,AnchorA,AnchorB,2,9)
    NewSeqA = 
       CGTGCGTAXXXX
    NewSeqB = 
       AGTGCATGTGXX
    Aadj =
       -1    4 
    Badj =
       -2    2
