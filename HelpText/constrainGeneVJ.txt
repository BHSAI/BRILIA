constrainGeneVJ will correct the V and J lengths based on expected
location of C and F/W. This is to prevent having a V length shorter than
the 104C location, and same for 118W for J gene. If there is an adjustment
that is required, it will realign the D segment to get a new Nvd-D-Ndj
segment.

  VDJdata = constrainGeneVJ(VDJdata, VDJheader, DB)

  [VDJdata, BadIdx] = constrainGeneVJ(...)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    DB: Gene database structure (getCurrentDatabase.m)

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata where V and J genes are set to cover the
      CDR3 region
