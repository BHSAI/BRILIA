checkVDJdata is more of a debugging script made to check entries of
VDJdata to ensure everything makes sense. If it encounters a bad set, will
save the bad entries into a [DebugFileName].mat file.

  [BadLoc, BadReason] = checkVDJdata(VDJdata,VDJheader,DebugFileName,DebugModeOn)

  INPUT
    DebugFileName: prefix name for the debug file to generate when an
      erroneous entry is encountered
    DebugModeOn: either 1 or 0 to turn on or off debugging.

  OUTPUT
    BadLoc: a Mx1 logical matrix showing where an error was encounter
    BadReason: a Mx1 cell matrix of text of the type of error encountered.
    
  NOTE
    Outputs automatically generated in the current working directory of
    only VDJdata entries where there is an error.

    You could use this code to filter out bad entries, by using the
    following commands:
      >> [BadLoc, BadReason] = checkVDJdata(VDJdata,VDJheader,'debug1');
      >> VDJdata(BadLoc,:) = [];
