clusterGene will perform the lineage-based clustering scheme used by
BRILIA. A crude cluster is first assembled based on save V and J "family
gene numbers", and afterwards, will determine which cluster belongs
together based on the SHM distance calculations. The cutoff distance has
been specfied as a % of the sequence length (DevPerc), though SHM distance
can return scores larger/smaller that DevPerc length of Seq depending on
if the SHM patterns match with expected patterns.

  VDJdata = clusterGene(VDJdata, VDJheader, DevPerc)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    DevPerc: Ranges 0 to 100, indicating % of sequence length to use as
      the cutoff SHM distance.

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata where sequences are clustered based on
      lineage relationships and maximum SHM distance, computed as:
      CutoffDist = DevPerc x SeqLength
