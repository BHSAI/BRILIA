calcTDTscore will calculate the probability terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase (TDT) assembles a nucleotide sequence, relative to random nt
insertion. Returns output as ProbTDT/ProbRandom. It will check forwards
and complement sequence to determine the score, which is the maximum score
of the 2 direction.

  TDTscore = calcTDTscore(Seq)

  TDTscore = calcTDTscore(Seq,Prob)

  INPUT
    Seq: nucleotide sequence consisting of ACGTU letters
    Prob: 1x4 matrix of probability that TDT adds a nucleotide. Must add
      to 1, and will replace the default probability values.
      Default values based on BRILIA analysis of mouse C57BL6 repertoire
      Prob = [0.25 0.08 0.60 0.07]; %[Pa Pc Pg Pt] 

  OUPUT
    TDTscore: Calculated as P_TDT/(P_Random + P_TDT), where 
      P_TDT = prod(Px,i) for all ith letter in sequence of length L
      P_Random = 0.25^L

  NOTES
    - Both the forward and complement sequence are used to determine the
      maximum TDTscore, which is the one that is returned. 
    - If no sequence are placed inside, will return an empty score [].
    - Ambiguous characters (eg 'N' or 'X') are NOT counted in the score.
