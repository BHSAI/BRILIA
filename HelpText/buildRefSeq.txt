buildRefSeq will fill in the predicted germline reference sequence for
each sequence cluster.

  [VDJdata, NewRange] = buildRefSeq(VDJdata, VDJheader, DB)

  VDJdata = buildRefSeq(VDJdata, VDJheader, DB, Chain, LengthOpt, InnerOpt, GroupOpt)

  INPUT OPTIONS, which can be in any order in inputs
    LengthOpt: 
      'full'      returns full length references
      'same'      returns same-length references as input seq
    InnerOpt: 
      'germline'  returns same-length sequences, subsituting VDJ with
                  germline genes. Nvd and Ndj are either from Seq1 or each
                  seq, depending on what the GroupOpt is set at.
      'preserve'  returns germline V + J ends with preserved, raw data
                  sequence (useful for protein digest studies, required
                  all sequence base the VDJ region).
    GroupOpt: 
      'single'    finds one RefSeq for each sequence
      'group'     finds and applies one RefSeq for entire group
      'first'     finds RefSeq for only the 1st seq in a group, in 
                  case you used the buildTree first, which will fix RefSeq
                  to ParentSeq.

  OUTPUT
    NewRange: the start and end nt sequence positions in Seq that the
      reference sequence is extracted from.
