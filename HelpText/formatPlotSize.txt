formatPlotSize is used to either create a new figure with a specified
figure size, or resize figures to remove excess border spacing, or
standardize the plot area size.

  [Gx,Ax] = formatPlotSize(Ax,FigW,FigH)

  [Gx,Ax] = formatPlotSize([],FigW,FigH)

  [Gx,Ax] = formatPlotSize([],FigW,FigH,Option)

  [Gx,Ax] = formatPlotSize([],FigW,FigH,Option,Param,Value,...)

  INPUT
    Ax: axes handle you want to resize. If empty, will generate an empty
      figure.
    FigW: width of the desired figure, in inches by default.
    FigH: height of the desired figure, in inches by default.
    Option ['outer','inner']: determines if you want to set the plot area
      (inner) or the whole figure (outer) size to FigW and FigH. Use the
      'inner' option if you want the plot area to be same sizes across
      multiple figures.
    
    Can use these param-value pairs after specifinn Option:
      Parmaeter Name  Value          Description
      --------------- ------------   -------------------------------------
      Units           'inch','cent'  Unit of measurement for figure
      AddBorder       N              Size of outer border in the unit of
                                       the figure.

  OUTPUT
    Gx: Figure handle
    Ax: Axes handle

  NOTE
    The returning figure will have its units changed out of normalize.
    This is because it's hard to adjust figure sizes using relative units
    of measurement. 

    Use this mainly to remove excess borders surrounding the plot areal

    Does not work if there are legends that go beyond the plotting area,
    since the legend locations are not included in the TightInset info.
