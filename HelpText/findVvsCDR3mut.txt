findVvsCDR3mut will look at each sequence, find the annotated V framework
mutation % vs CDR3 region mutations %. Plot of Vmut vs CDR3mut will reveal
differences in predicted SHM across different annotation results.

Output = [VframeMutFr CDR3MutFr]

  VframeMutFr = nts including the 104C codon / length of VCDR3-Framework
  length

  CDR3MutFr = nts from 105-117 CDR3 / length of CDR3 regions
