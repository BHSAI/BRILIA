showHelpText will display a m file's help text on the command line, which
should be stored in a 'HelpText' folder. This is a workaround solution for
matlab's inability to show help text in compiled codes.

  showHelpText('Name', Name, 'HelpTextDir', HelpTextDir)

  INPUT
    Name: the name of the function or m file (without the .m)
    HelpDir: the directory storing all help text files created from
      compileHelpText
