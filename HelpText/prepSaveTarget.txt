prepSaveTarget will prepare the folder and/or file name to use for
saving items. This was created to simplify making decisions for
where to save a file given a certain combination of inputs. This
function will also attempt to create the directory to save the target
files.

  [FullSaveName, ValidTarget] = prepSaveTarget(Param, Value, ...)

  INPUT
    Param-Value pairs are as follows:
    Param        Value    Description
    -----------  -------  ------------------------------------------------
    SaveAs         ''     Full or just file name to use w or w/o extension
    SavePrefix     ''     Any string you want to add between the save file
                            name and the extension (EX: If SavePrefix =
                            '.grp1', then save.png => save.grp1.png
    SaveExt        ''     The file extension to use. See note.
    SaveDir        ''     Save directory to use for saving files. Will use
                            current dir if SaveAs has not file path and
                            SaveDir is empty.
    SaveSubDir     ''     Sub directory to add on top of any dir in SaveAs
                            or DefaultDir. Used to simplify adding a sub
                            dir under an original file dir.
    MakeSaveDir    'n'    Will only return the FullSaveName.
                   'y'    Will attempt to create the save dir. 
    DefaultSaveAs  ''     Will use this if SaveAs is empty. Hint: Let the
                            function that is going to actually write the
                            file specify as SaveSubDir and DefaultSaveAs.

  OUTPUT
    FullSaveName: The full file path and name to use for saving the file

  NOTE
    SaveExt does not have to be specified if SaveAs has the extension, BUT
    if specified, will override what is in SaveAs extension. This is to
    allow users to use a source file name for the SaveAs value, and to
    simply change the extension to an image. 

    The default order of preference for saving are as follows:
    SavePath = SaveAs folder > SaveDir folder > or DefaultDir (cd)
    *Having a SaveSubDir will ALWAYS created a subdir
    SaveName = SaveAs file name > error
    SaveExt = This overrides SaveAs' file ext > SaveAs file ext > error
    
  EXAMPLE
    FileName = 'c:\local\file.csv'
    FullSaveName = prepSaveTarget('SaveAs', FileName, 'SaveExt', ...
                                               '.png', 'SavePrefix', '.2')
    FullSaveName = 
          'c:\local\file.2.png'

    SaveName = 'file.csv'
    SavePre = '.3'
    SavePath = 'c:\local'
    SaveSubDir = '\Plots\New'
    FullSaveName = prepSaveTarget('SaveAs', SaveName, 'SaveSubDir', ...
                    SaveSubDir, SavePrefix', SavePre, 'SaveDir', SavePath)
    FullSaveName = 
          'c:\local\Plots\file.3.csv'
