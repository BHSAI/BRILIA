calcDistribDist will compute the pairwise distance matrix for
distrubutions, in which the distance matrix reveals how divergent two
distributions are from each other.

  DistMat = calcDivergeDist(Ydata)

  DistMat = calcDivergeDist(Ydata, 'Method', Method)

  INPUT
    Ydata: MxN matrix containing M value entries for N distributions
      Example, Ydata = [ 0.1 0.2;  %2 distributions, 4 bins.
                         0.2 0.4;
                         0.3 0.2;
                         0.4 0.4]
    Method: method for calculating divergence between two distributions
      'overl': (default) Overlapping distance between two distrubtions
        Distance = 1 -  Overlap / (Total - Overlap), where Overlap
        is the minimum overlap value between two entry values. 
      'bhatt': Bhattacharyya distance between two distributions
        Distance = -ln( sum( (Px * Qx)^0.5 ) )
  
  OUTPUT
    DistMat: NxN pairwise distance for the N distributions
