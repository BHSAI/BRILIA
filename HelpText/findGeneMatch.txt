findGeneMatch will look for the best sequence match to a gene database
sequence set. This is the core alignment-based gene search.

  GeneMatch = findGeneMatch(Seq, Xmap, X, MissRate)

  GeneMatch = findGeneMatch(Seq, Xmap, X, MissRate, CDR3anchor)

  GeneMatch = findGeneMatch(Seq, Xmap, X, MissRate, CDR3anchor, 'ForceAnchor')
 
  INPUTS
    Seq: Character sequence
    Xmap: Database DB.[X]map, where [X] is V, D, J, Vk, Vl, Jk, or Jl.
    X ['V', 'D', 'J']: character specifying what segment to match. Does not
      have to specify heavy/light chain Vs or Js.
    MissRate [Integer >= 0]: How many missed nt/bp are allowed for
      elongating a contiguous C region for alignment score. Ex: MissRate
      0.02 = 2% of shorter seq length.
    MissRate: How many point mutations per nt are allowed during
      alignment. Default is 0.00, and ranges from 0.00 to 1.00.
    CDR3anchor: Positions of potential 104C 1st nt of codon or 118W 3rd nt
      of codon. CDR3 anchor can be a matrix of values, and providing it
      speeds up alignment and reduces chance of incorrect J alignments, 
      especially when dealing with shorter sequences cut at the 118W.
   'ForceAnchor': will force findGeneMatch to find a solution that matches
      to at least one of the anchor points. Will not attempt a unseeded
      alignment if the seeded alignment gives a low alignment % (below 70%
      match).

  OUTPUT
    GeneMatch: 1x6 cell array of cells containing gene match data as follows
      Col1   Gene number in Xmap
      Col2   Full gene name(s)
      Col3   [LeftLength MiddleLength RighLength] of the reference gene
      Col4   [LeftLength MiddleLength RighLength] of the Seq
      Col5   [(# of matches) AlignmentScore]
      Col6   3xN character alignment results
