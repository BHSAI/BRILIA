parseFileName will take a filename string and parse it into Path, Name,
and FileExt. This is better than MATLAB's fileparts, which yields
filepaths that lack the ending slash, or yields filenames without the
extensions.

  [FilePath, FileName, FileExt] = parseFileName(FullName)

  [FilePath, FileName, FileExt] = parseFileName(FullName, 'ignorefilecheck')

  INPUT
    FullName: file path and name to be parsed
    'ignorefilecheck': use this to prevent parseFileName from checking if
      file exists, especially when file path is not provided in the
      FullName. This is used mainly for parsing a save file name. Note
      that without this option, FilePath will return [] if file does not
      exists. If ignorefilecheck, will return current directly as file
      path.

  OUTPUT
    FilePath: File path for the FullName, including end slasshes EX:
      'C:\Users\User1\PathFolder\'
    FileName: File name including any extensions, if any 'test.csv'
    FileExt: File extension only, including the dot. Ex: '.csv'

  EX: 
    F = 'C:\Users\Desktop\testing.xlsx';
    [FilePath, FileName, FileExt] = parseFileName(F, 'ignorefilecheck')
      FilePath =  C:\Users\Desktop\
      FileName =  testing.xlsx
      FileExt =  .xlsx
