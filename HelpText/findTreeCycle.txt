findTreeCycle will look for the AncMap entries that causes a cyclic loop.

  CycleLoc = findTreeCycle(AncMap)

  INPUT
    AncMap: ancestral map index from calcAncMap

  OUTPUT
    CycleLoc: logical array of size(AncMap, 1) marking members that have
      parent-child-parent cyclic dependencies
