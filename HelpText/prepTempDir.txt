prepTempDir will prepare a Temp dir for a particular BRILIA run to
ensure that the TempDir exists and that no Raw.csv and Final.csv exists.
This is the preferred method of preparing the Temp dir, just in case the
user stores files into the Temp folder or has a same name Temp folder, in
which BRILIA should NOT delete all contents inside the Temp dir and cause
headaches.

  prepTempDir(TempDir)

  prepTempDir(TempDir, 'delete')

  INPUT
    TempDir: the path where files will be temporarily stored when BRILIA
      is running.
    'delete': will delete the TempDir ONLY if it is empty
