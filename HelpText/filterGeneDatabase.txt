filterRefGene will process the database DB to retain only those of
interest, as defined by the filter criteria.

  DB = filterRefGene(DB,Param,Value)
  
  INPUT
    DB: database structure from getCurrentDatabase.m
    Param-Value paris are as follows
      Parameter     Value
      ------------  ------------------------
      Strain        'All' 'C57BL' 'BALB', ...
      Ddirection    'All' 'fwd' 'rev' (or 'inv')
      Vfunction     'All' 'F' 'P' 'ORF' 

  OUTPUT
    DB: the filtered version of the input DB, where unused gene sequences
      are set to empty ''. This prevents the shifting of Map numbering
      schemes required by the software to perform.
