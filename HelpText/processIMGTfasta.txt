processIMGTfasta will take the fasta germline VDJ gene sequences from 
http://www.imgt.org/vquest/refseqh.html and convert them into usable
database file for BRILIA. Below is the direction to use this.

  1) Save reference sequences from http://www.IMGT.org/vquest/refseqh.html
     into a fasta text file, where the file name starts with either:
        IGHV_SpeciesName.fa
        IGHD_SpeciesName.fa
        IGHJ_SpeciesName.fa
        IGKV_SpeciesName.fa
        IGKJ_SpeciesName.fa
        IGLV_SpeciesName.fa
        IGLJ_SpeciesName.fa

  2) Run processIMGTfasta, and select the folder where all those files are
     stored.

  OUTPUT
     A csv files with the name [SpeciesName].csv storing all the processed
       sequence file. This is what's loaded by getGeneDatabase.
  
  NOTE
    There are 8 variables as follows:
      Header: contains the header information of the ref seq maps
      Vmap  = IGHV genes
      Dmap  = IGHD genes
      Jmap  = IGHJ genes
      Vkmap = IGKV genes, kappa
      Jkmap = IGKJ genes, kappa
      Vlmap = IGLV genes, lambda
      Jlmap = IGLJ genes, lambda

    The Header contains the following information fields:
      Seq: nucleotide sequence with IMGT's ... notation removed
      GeneName: IMGT or custom gene name
      Function: functionality of gene, P = pseudo, F = functional, ORF =
        open reading frame.
      Host: Host strain information, if available
      CDR1start: Locations of CDR1 first nt
      CDR1end: Locations of CDR1 last nt
      CDR2start: Locations of CDR2 first nt
      CDR2end: Locations of CDR2 last nt
      AnchorDist: Distance from V gene 3' end, or J gene 5' end, to
        the 1st nt of the codon of the constant residue 104C or 118 W/F.

  NOTE
    The the last column will ALWAYS be the anchor distance, due to other
    function calling on the last column to be the anchor. Col 1 is ALWAYS
    the sequence, and Col2 is ALWAYS the ref gene name.

  DEVELOPER'S NOTE
    The first and last column of a map matrix MUST be the Seq and
    AnchorDist. This is because alignment algorithms assume this, to
    prevent having to spend time searching for this.
