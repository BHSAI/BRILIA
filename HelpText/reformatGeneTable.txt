reformateGeneTable will fill in the empty spaces in the gene table file,
caused by IMGT's merged table format issues. 

  INPUT
    The input files are excel tables that have undergone the following:
    1) Copy and paste the IMGT gene table into Excel
    2) Unmerge all cells
    3) Move headers with "Strain", "Clone Names", etc to the top row, 
       overwritting any headers above these. 
    4) Delete extra header rows
    5) Save the excel table as [filename]_Raw.xlsx

  OUTPUT
    Returns a ; delimited formatted table that removes empty columns, and
    fills in the column with the full gene name, which is required for the
    next step of extracting strains given a full gene name.

  NOTE
    Gene table can be found at IMGT, for instance at
    http://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&
    repertoire=genetable&species=Mus_musculus&group=IGKV.
