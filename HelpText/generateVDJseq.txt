generateVDJseq will generate VDJ genes by randomly selecting germline VDJ
genes, randomly deleting nts from gene edges, randomly creating N regions, 
and then combining them into a single sequence. Somatic hyper mutation
simulations are performed if SHMrate > 0. A mutated sequence is added to
the dataset only if it reaches SHMrate level of mutation. Only productive
VDJ rearrangements are stored since these are the one that can go undergo
SHM. We are not considering unproductive VDJ genes in the 2nd chromosome
that could also undergo SHM if there is a productive gene.

  [VDJdata, VDJheader] = generateVDJseq(Param, Value, ...)

  INPUT
    Param           Value                 This sets:
    ------------    --------------------  -------------------------
    SaveAs          [FileName].csv        Place to store VDJdata. If
                                            empty, asks users to choose.
    CloneCount      1 <= N <= 10000       # of germline VDJ seq to make
    BranchLength    1 <= N <= 20          # of linear descendants per
                                            branch per group
    BranchWidth     1 <= N <= 20          # of branches per group
    SHMperc         0 <= N <= 100         % of SHMs per descendant
    TDTon           'y' 'n'               Include TDT-based N regions
    Species         'human' 'mouse' etc   VDJ database by species
    Strain          'all' 'C57BL' etc     VDJ database by strain
    Ddirection      'all' 'fwd' 'inv'     Allowed D gene direction
    Vfunction       'all' 'f' 'p' 'orf'   Allowed V gene functions

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: cell matrix storing all information about each VDJgene
    VDJheader: cell matrix storing data field names for VDJdata
  
  NOTE
    The total number of sequences generated will be CloneCount *
    BranchLength * BranchCount.

    Simulation of SHMs does not account for SHM hot spots yet.

    VDJ recombination event does not account for bias in certain gene
    usage. Instead, selects gene uniformly.

    VDJ gene edge deletions follow exponential distrbution with mean
    deletion counts determined by literature data. Max deletion is capped
    at 13 to prevent complete gene deletion issues.

    Nregions are synthesized according to the behavior of Terminal
    Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase. which mostly adds A's and G's, or C's
    and T's.

    Only genes with well-defined C and W locations can be used.
