getMutData will extract the SHMs between germline-child and
parent-child sequence relationships. Returns two output structures:
MutCorr for 4x4 pairwise SHM mutation plotting, and MutFreq for total
sequence mutation hisograms.

  [MutCorr, MutFreq] = getMutData

  [MutCorr, MutFreq] = getMutData(VDJdata, VDJheader)

  [MutCorr, MutFreq] = getMutData(FileName)

  [MutCorr, MutFreq] = getMutData(..., Param, Value)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: MxN cell of all VDJ annotaiton data
    VDJheader: 1xN cell of all header name for VDJdata
    FileName: Full file name of the BRILIA output file

      Param           Value           Description
      -------------   -------------   ------------------------------------
      'Functional'    'y' 'n' 'all'   Specify which functional H + L genes
                                        to use (Default 'y')

  OUTPUT
    MutFreq: structure containing relevant SHM data such. Field are:
      Germ2Child: Mx2 matrix of SHMs calculated between germline to child.
        (Col 1) and the length of the sequence (Col 2)
      Par2Child: Mx2 2matrix of SHMs calculated between Par to child.
        (Col 1) and the length of the sequence (Col 2)

  NOTE
    Only FUNCTIONAL annotations are done here. To do nonfunctional, 
    specify that as the input.
