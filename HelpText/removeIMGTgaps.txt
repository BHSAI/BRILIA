removeIMGTgaps will get a V gene sequence and remove gaps. Will return a
string data that can be used to get the gaps back.

  [NoGapSeq, GapInfo] = removeIMGTgaps(Seq)

  INPUT
    Seq: nt sequence given by IMGT
  
  OUTPUT
    NoGapSeq: nt sequence without gaps, replacing wildcard gaps with 'X'
    GapInfo: A string sequence in the format M(-G(M(-G, where +M numbers
      are nt counts, and -G numbers are gap counts.
      count. This is used to return a NoGapSeq to a GappedSeq

  EXAMPLE
    Seq = 'cag...gtt...act...gaatctgca...ctcac';
    [NoGapSeq, GapInfo] = removeIMGTgaps(Seq)
    NoGapSeq =
      caggttactgaatctgcactcac
    GapInfo =
      3#-3#3#-3#3#-3#9#-3#5
