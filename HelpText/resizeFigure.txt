resizeFigure is used to resize the total figure height and width, while
scaling the internal contents. It can also be used to created an empty
figure of specified height and dimension prior to adding plots. Always
uses inches for the figure size.

  Gx = resizeFigure(W, H)

  Gx = resizeFigure(Gx, W, H)

  Gx = resizeFigure(Ax, W, H)

  Gx = resizeFigure(Gx, W, H, 'off', 'n')

  INPUT
    Gx: figure handle
    Ax: axes handle that is used to determine the figure (parent of Ax)
    H: height of the figure in inches
    W: width of the figure in inches
    'off' or 'on': turns Visible on or off
    'n' or 'y': y to recenter figure after resizing, n to never recenter.

  OUTPUT
    Gx: figure handle that was modified

  NOTE
    Use resizeSubplots(Gx, ...) to resize subplots inside Gx to fill the
    space, align axes, etc.
