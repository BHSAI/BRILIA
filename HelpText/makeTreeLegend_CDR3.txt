makeTreeLegend_CDR3 will take CDR3 sequences in a Mx1 cell, and return a
cell matrix of unique CDR3s that have been compared against the first
CDR3. This is used mainly to provide the legend text for trees.

  [CDR3legend, UnqCDR3seq, Idx] = makeTreeLegend_CDR3(CDR3seq)

  INPUT
    CDR3seq: Mx1 cell of CDR3 amino acid sequences, where the first one is
      considered the root. 

  OUTPUT
    CDR3legend: a Mx1 cell containing formatted CDR3 sequences, where
      matched letters to the first CDR3seq are replaced by '-'.
    UnqCDR3seq: a Mx1 cell containing the unique CDR3 sequences, ordered
      the same way as CDR3legend.
    Idx: a Nx1 matrix same length as CDR3seq that maps the Mth position of
      UnqCDR3seq to each entry of CDR3seq. This index is used to help
      assign a unique color to each unique CDR3 sequence.
