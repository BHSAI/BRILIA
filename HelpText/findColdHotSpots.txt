findColdHotSpots will find hot spots of AID, and then determine the AA
mutation frequencies at these hot spots.
1) Find WRC and GYW hotspots
2) Calculate the mutation R(i-->b)I , where R is the relative mutations of
   nt i turning to b (c -- > a, g, t), and I is 1 if this changes the AA,
   or 0 if this does not change the AA. 
3) Take sum of R*I to get weight  probability of mutating this residue due
   to AID SHM.
4) Compute total R*I within a clonotype, which reflect the number of
   "opportunities" for mutations.
5) Compute the actual Mutation of AA due to C mutations
6) Compare the distbution of C mutations per position 
   EX:    X axis = Position number where mutatable C was found
          Y1r = number of exp mutations of the C that can lead to new AA
          Y1s = number of exp mutations of the C that lead to silent
                mutations
          Y2r = number of real mutations of the C that lead to new AA
          Y2s = number of real mutations that lead to silent mutations
