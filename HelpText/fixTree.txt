fixTree will look through VDJdata tree structures,  and flip the root seq
with first seq IF it doesn't make sense. One way to figure this out is to
see if the 1st seq has MORE shm than another seq. Do this at the way end, 
after D and N regions are fixed.

  VDJdata = fixTree(VDJdata, VDJheader)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata with cluster sequences reordered and
      relinked via phylogeny lineage.
