getHotspoutMutData will count the number of hotspot in the CDR3 and FWR3,
and the observed hotspot mutations in the CDR3 and FWR3, all at the
nucleotide level.

Hotspot for AID: WRC / GYW

[Hcdr, Hfwr, Ncdr, Nfwr] = getHotspoutMutData(VDJdata, VDJheader)

  INPUT

  OUTPUT
    Hcdr: number of C/G hotspots in the CDR
    Hfwr: number of C/G hotspots in the FWR
    Ncdr: number of mutated hotspot C/G's in the CDR
    Nfwr: number of mutated hotspot C/G's in the FWR
