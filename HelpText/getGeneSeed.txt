getGeneSeed will look through the database V or J genes, and extract N
number of nts of the framework regions, including the conserved C and W
codon set. 

  SeedSeq = getGeneSeed(DB,X,Nleft,Nright,Alphabet)

  INPUT
    DB: gene database structure(getCurrentDatabase.m)
    X ['V' 'Vk' 'Vl' 'J' 'Jk' 'Jl']: Specificy what database gene is used.
    Nleft: number of NT or AA left of anchor
    Nright: number of NT or AA right of anchor
    Alphabet ['nt' or 'aa']: Choose NT or AA letters

  OUTPUT
    SeedSeq: cell array of NT or AA sequences that can be used for
      alignment purposes. 

  NOTE
    Genes without a solid anchor point C or W are REMOVED from SeedSeq
    output! This is to prevent confusion pinpointing where the seed
    sequence marks the position of the C or W.
