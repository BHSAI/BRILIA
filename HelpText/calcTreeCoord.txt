calcTreeCoord is used to calculate the node and leaf coordinates
recursively, given AncMap (the ancestry mapping matrix).
  
  TreeCoord = calcTreeCoord(AncMap)

  TreeCoord = calcTreeCoord(AncMap, TreeCoord, ParentNum)  (For recursion)

  INPUT
    AncMap: Mx3 ancestry map of [ChildNum ParentNum Par2ChildDist].
      Par2ChildDist is either hamming distance or SHM distance from parent
      to child. A ParentNum = 0 means germline root.
   
  OUTPUT
    TreeCoord: (M+x)x3 matrix of [Xpos Ypos LeafStatus].
      IF the distance from root to 1st real sequence is 0, then x = 0.
      IF the root is not the same as th 1st sequence, then x = 1 and a
        extra coordinate is provided from root to 1st sequence.
      LeafStatus is 0 if this child is also a parent.
      LeafStatus is 1 if this child ends the tree as a leaf.

  NOTE
    This uses recusion to fill in TreeCoord, hence TreeCoord is a hidden
    input to the function that shouldn't be used by the user.
