findConsecLoc will take a binary array and locate the "furthest" position
of a consecutively matched segment that is away from either the left or
right side of a logical array. Used mainly in trimGeneEdge.

  TrimLen = findConsecLoc(Q,MinConsec,StartSide) 

  INPUTS
    Q: A 1xN logical matrix
    MinConsec: Minimum number of consecutive matches to find
    StartSide ['left','right']: Start looking from this side
  
  OUTPUTS
    TrimLen: Number of nts to trim to cover the consective matched region.

  EXAMPLE
    Q = [0 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0];
    MinConsec = 3;
    TrimLen = findConsecLoc(Q,MinConsec,'left')
    TrimLen = 
           13
    TrimLen = findConsecLoc(Q,MinConsec,'right')
    TrimLen = 
           14
