getUniqueAxes is designed to find unique axes, which can be cumbersome if
using a workaround where one plot has > 1 axes overlaying its position. If
two axes have the same positions, getUniqueAxes will return the one unique
axes, but for each one return which are supposedly the duplicate one.
Returns the position and tight insets of each unique plot as if the axes
formed one plot.

  INPUT
    Gx: figure handle
 
  OUTPUT
    UnqAxCell: a cell of axes handle array, where each cell stores axes
      handles that have > 50% overlap in plotting area.
    AllPositions: Mx4 position matrix of the first plot with a background
      color per each unique group of axes
    AllTights: Mx4 tight inset matrix of the first plot with a background
      color per each unique group of axes
