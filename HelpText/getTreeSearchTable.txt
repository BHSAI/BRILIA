getTreeSearchTable is designed to display a table listing the tree size,
V, D, J family, and tree image file name for use as a quick glance of the
lineage trees for a particular file.

  TreeSearchTable = getTreeSearchTable(VDJdata, VDJheader)

  INPUT
    TreeData: output from collectTreeData

  OUTPUT
    TreeSearchTable: condensed table for viewing contents of the tree. The
      first row is the header of the column.
        GrpNum: BRILIA-assigned group number
        TreeSize: total number of unique sequences
        TotalTemplateCount: sum of all sequence template counts
        H-Vgene: heavy chain V gene name
        H-Dgene: heavy chain D gene name
        H-Jgene: heavy chain J gene name
        H-CDR3: germline CDR3 per cluster of the heavy chain
        L-Vgene: light chain V gene name
        L-Jgene: light chain J gene name
        L-CDR3: germline CDR3 per cluster of the light chain
        TreeImageName: file name of the corresponding group lineage tree
