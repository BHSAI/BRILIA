trimGeneEdge will trim the V-(D)-J gene ends according to several logic
rules, which can be added or modified over time depending on newly gained
knowledge. This is the function to add exception rules to gene edge
finding.

  VDJdata = trimGeneEdge(VDJdata, VDJheader)

  NOTES ON LOGIC RULES
    1) Identify "consensus" mismatch using 50% majority rule, inclusive of
       50% split.

    2) Trim at >= 3 consec mismatches that happens between 104C and 118W.
       |||xxx||  ->  oooooo|| if we are trimming left side.
                 ->  |||ooooo if we are trimming right side.
 
    3) Trim at consensus mismatch if it increases TDTscore. For lack of initial N region, the TDTscore starts at 0.5.
       'ACGTGgGT       'ACGTG ggt'
       'ACcTGgGT'  ->  'ACcTG ggt'
       'AcGTGgGT'      'AcGTG ggt'

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    DB: Gene database structure (getCurrentDatabase.m)

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata with more precise Nvd, Ndj, or Nvj.
