makeClassifier will make a letter sequence that labels each nt by the
segment it belongs to. The "Classifier" sequence is stored in VDJdata in
the "Classifier" column.

  VDJdata = makeClassifier(VDJdata,VDJheader)

  EXAMPLE
    Classifier = 'VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVppmmmppDDDDDDppnnppJJJJJJJJJ';
      V = V   segment
      M = Nvd region
      D = D   segment
      N = Ndj region
      J = J   segment
      B = p-nucleotides in the Nvd region
      P = p-nucleotides in the Ndj region
      v,m,d,n,j,b,p = lowercase are mismatched with the reference sequence
