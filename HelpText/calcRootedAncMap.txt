calcRootedAncMap perform the tree linking given a defined cluster, where
the first seq is the most ancestral seq.
  
The way it works is this: 
1) First seq "was" set as ancestor before puting the input in.
2) Find the "next" seq with lowest score, and link it to root.
3) Find the "next" seq with lowest score, and link it to root or other seq.
4) repeat 3 until no more linking is left.

  AncMap = calcRootedAncMap(PairDist)

  INPUT
    PairDist: a MxM matrix of distances between sequences, where the row
      is the parent and col is the child sequences. 1st Row and Col is for
      the root sequence.

  OUTPUT
    AncMap: a Mx3 matrix storing information about each child object's
      parent object and the SHM distance from parent to child object.

  NOTE
    This does not have a cutoff distance as it will link everything to the
    ancestral sequence.
    
    Unlike calcAncMap, calcRootedAncMap does not generate cyclic
    dependencies since the root is defined and this prevents the issue.
