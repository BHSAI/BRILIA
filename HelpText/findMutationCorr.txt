findMutationCorr will plot the AT mutation% vs GC mutation% to see if
there is a linear correlation. This would indicate ADAR and AID act same
time. If you see a vertical / horizontal instead, that would indicate they
do not act same time. Y axis is ADAR mutation, whereas X axis is AID
mutation.

We do NOT consider N regions, as there are highly biased towards C/G, and
thus normalization would be ruined. We thus focus ONLY onlg annotated
V,D,J regions.
Output is [AmutCt CmutCt GmutCt Tmutct TotA TotC TotG TotT
  XmutCt = number of X that were mutated in the RefSeq
  TotX = number of X that exists in the RefSeq
