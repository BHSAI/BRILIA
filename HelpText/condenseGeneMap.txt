function condenseGeneMap will convert a large DB into a smaller one for
improved alignment speed. For instance, there is no need to do 400 V gene
alignements if 200 of them are very similar to another one or are alleles.
This cuts down the alignment time, though the actual V must be determine
using the full sequence.
