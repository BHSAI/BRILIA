getTreeData2 will extract necessary information required to plot a tree
given VDJdata from ONE cluster (same group number).

  INPUT
    Tdata: the MxN data subset of VDJdata for the same group number. Will
      complain if multiple group numbers are detected.
    VDJheader: the 1xN cell of data header names of VDJdata

  OUPUT
    AncMapStruct: Structure holding various Mx3 AncMap
      .HAM = AncMap with par2child hamming distance
      .SHM = AncMap with par2child BRILIA shm distance
      .HAMPERC = AncMap with par2child hamming distance / seq length
      .SHMPERC = AncMap with par2child BRILIA shm distance / seq length
    TreeName: suggested name of the tree based on VDJ and VJ annotation.
      If H chain, {'Vgene | Dgene | Jgene' 'Grp #, Size #, TC #'}
      If L chain, {'Vxgene | Jxgene' 'Grp #, Size #, TC #'}
      If HL chains, {'Vgene | Dgene | Jgene' 'Vxgene | Jxgene' 
                                                   'Grp #, Size #, TC #'}
      where Size of the group in number of unique sequence, TC is total
      template count of the group.
    CDR3Names: is a Mx1 cell of CDR3 names used for making color legends.
      IF H or L chain, CDR3Names is just CDR3's
      If HL chain, CDR3Names is joined by a dash as CDR3H-CDR3L
    TemplateCount: Template count to use for drawing tree. For germline, 
      will set to 0.

  NOTE
    IF germline is the same as the 1st sequence of the group, will return
    all values of the same number of entries as Tdata.
    IF germline is different from the 1st sequence, will add the germline
    sequence as an entry but with 0 template count, returning parameters
    with size(Tdata,1) + 1 entries.
