plotMutCorrScatter will plot the X0 -> X1 mutation frequencies as
determined per segment of the full VDJ gene. For instance, it will compare
A -> G mutation in the V gene segment versus the D and J gene segments.
This is used mainly to discern how well the annotation results yielded
consisted SHMs accross the VDJ segments. Returns the slope and Pearson
correlation value for a 12-point scatter plot, where each point is a
unique X0 -> X1 mutation.

  [Gx, Ax] = plotMutCorrScatter

  [Gx, Ax] = plotMutCorrScatter(MutCorr)

  [Gx, Ax] = plotMutCorrScatter(...,Param,Value,...)
 
  [Gx, Ax] = plotMutCorrScatter(...,P)

  P = plotMutCorrScatter('getinput')

  INPUT
    MutCorr: structured data of pairwise mutations returned by getMutData
    P: a structure containing P.(Param) = Value information. This input
       option might be easier for adjusting plot parameters. You can also
       use the direct param, cell pair input listed below. To make a
       default P structure, use P = plotMutCorrScatter('GetInput');

    Some plot features can be set using the following Param-Value pairs:
      Param           Value       Description
      --------------  ----------  ----------------------------------------
      PairWith        'parent'    Uses SHM data between child and parent
                      'germline'  Uses SHM data between child and germline
      AddCorr         'y' 'n'     Show pearson correlation coef., Rcorr
      AddFitLine      'y' 'n'     Show the linear fit line of points
      AddLegend       'y' 'n'     Show legend
      AddXtitle       'y' 'n'     Show x axis label
      AddYtitle       'y' 'n'     Show y axis label
      LegendFontSize  12          Set the font size of the legend
      MarkerSize      250         Set the size of the scatter plot dots
      Xseg            'D,J'       Adds all segs for X-values (see Note)
      Yseg            'V'         Adds all segs for Y-values (see Note)

    *To modify plots, use param-value pairs from setAxes.m and setFig.m.
 
    *To save the resulting plots, use param-value paris from savePlot.m.

  OUTPUT
    Gx: figure handle
    Ax: axes handle

  NOTE
    Xseg and Yseg is a string input of segments, which can include any of
      the following segment names:
      'V' 'Nvd' 'D' 'Ndj' 'J' 'Vx' 'Nx' 'Jx' 'HCDR3' 'LCDR3'};
