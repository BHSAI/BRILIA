seedCDR3position will find "potential" locations for 104C first or 118W/F
last nt codon within in a sequence. This function could also check both
forward and reverse direction, flipping the sequence direction with the
highest seed alignment score and lowest variability in seed location
(since incorrect direction will lead to many bad alignments and
positions).

  VDJdata = seedCDR3position(VDJdata,VDJheader,DB,X,Nleft,Nright,CheckSeqDir)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    DB: Gene database structure (getCurrentDatabase.m)
    X ['V' 'Vk' 'Vl' 'J' 'Jk' 'Jl']: Specificy what database gene is used.
      Can use combinations such as 'Vl,Vk'.
    Nleft: num of nts left of CDR3 codon 1st nt Anchor for align seed. 
    Nright: num of nts right of CDR3 codon 1st nt Anchor for align seed.
    CheckSeqDir ['n' or 'y']: no or yes for checking both sequence
      directions. If 'y', Will take complements of sequences if needed.

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: processed BRILIA data cell

  NOTE
    This will fill VDJdata with the CDR3 start and end positions with
    single or multiple integer values. The findVDJmatch will use these
    seeded locations to speed up the alignment process, whereas
    updateVDJdata will select the final values.

    Cannot seed a heavy and light chain V or J together. Ex, X = 'V, Vk'
    will not work.
