findStrainMatch will compare a gene name and identify all host strains
that have this gene, based on IMGT's gene table that can be found at
http://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire
=genetable&species=Mus_musculus&group=IGHD, but pasted into Excel and
formatted with reformatGeneTable.m. 

  AllStrains = findStrainMatch(GeneName,GeneTable)

  INPUT
    GeneName: The full IMGT gene name that you are looking for strain info
    GeneTable: The gene table downloaded from IMGT, inlcuding the header

  OUTPUT
    AllStrains: string of all strains of a host that has the GeneName,
      sepeartaed by ";"

  NOTE
    To get the gene table, go the gene table website in IMGT (see above)
    and then copy and paste the table. Use reformatGeneTable.m to format the
    tables to a more standardized format.
