calcHAMdist will do pairwise comparison of two sequences and return the
number of mismatched letters. By default, an 'X' is a wildcard.

  HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2)

  HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2,WildCard)

  INPUT
    Seq1: sequence string
    Seq2: Mx1 cell of sequences, or a sequence string
    WildCard ['y' 'n']: Determines if an 'X' character is a wildcard or
      not. Default is WildCard = 'y'.

  OUTPUT
    HamDist: Mx1 matrix of mismatched letters between Seq1 and Seq2.

  NOTE
    'X' is a wildcard match.

    If Seq1 and Seq2 are variable lengths, then HamDist is calculated as
    number of mismatched letters up to the length of the shorter sequence,
    plus the difference in sequence lengths:

  EXAMPLES
    Seq1 = 'ACXTAT' 
    Seq2 = 'ATGTGT'
    HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2)
    HamDist = 
               2

    HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2,'n')
    HamDist = 
               3

    Seq2 = {'ACXT','ATGTGT'};
    HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1,Seq2,'n')
    HamDist = 
               2
               3
