calcHAMdist will return a matrix with the number of mismatched letters
between one sequence and one or many other sequence(s). By default, an 'X'
is a wildcard.

  HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2)

  HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2, MatchWild)

  INPUT
    Seq1: a sequence. UPPERCASE only.
    Seq2: a sequence or a Mx1 cell of sequences. UPPERCASE only.
    MatchWild ['y' 'n']: Determines if an 'X' character should be treated
      as a wildcard or not. Default is MatchWild = 'y'. 

  OUTPUT
    HamDist: Mx1 matrix of mismatched letters between Seq1 and Seq2.

  NOTE
    If Seq1 and Seq2 are variable lengths, then HamDist is calculated as
    number of mismatched letters up to the length of the shorter sequence, 
    plus the difference in sequence lengths:

  EXAMPLES
    Seq1 = 'ACXTAT' 
    Seq2 = 'ATGTGT'
    HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2)
    HamDist = 
               2

    HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2, 'n')
    HamDist = 
               3

    Seq2 = {'ACXT', 'ATGTGT'};
    HamDist = calcHAMdist(Seq1, Seq2, 'n')
    HamDist = 
               0
               3
