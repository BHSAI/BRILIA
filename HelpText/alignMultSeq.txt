alignMultSeq will take a cell string of sequences, and align them with
respect to 1st seq in the series

  AlignSeq = alignMultSeq(SeqSet)

  [AlignSeq, ConsSeq] = alignMultSeq(SeqSet)

  INPUT
    SeqSet: a Mx1 cell of sequences to be aligned, where the 1st sequence
      is the reference sequence

  OUTPUT
    AlignSeq: Mx1 cell of sequences that were aligned to the 1st sequence
      of SeqSet. Paddings are added as '-' to ensure sequences have the
      same lengths.
