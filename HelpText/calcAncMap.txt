calcAncMap will take a PairDist matrix, and then link the numbers using
nearest neighbor method, with priority on shorter distances.

  AncMap = calcAncMap(PairDist)

  AncMap = calcAncMap(PairDist,TriangleSide)

  INPUT
    PairDist: a MxM dissimilarity matrix, or matrix storing a distance
      value from paired objects. Diagonal values will not be used for
      linking. 
    TriangleSide ['botleft' 'topright']: Specify which side of PairDist
      symmetric matrix to use for finding parent-distance pairs. Defaults
      to 'both' in case there is an assymmetric distance matrix.

  OUTPUT
    AncMap: a Mx3 matrix storing information about each child object's
      parent object and the distance from parent to child object.

  NOTE
    Each column is the child, and the row is the parent. So PairDist(1,2)
    = 0.2 would mean Distance from Object 1 parent to Object 2 child is
    0.2

    Unlike calcRootedAncMap, calcAncMap can generate cyclic dependencies
    due if give Both triangle sides and an assymmetric matrix.
