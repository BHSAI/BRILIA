mapData2AncMap will take Tdata (subset of VDJdata for same clonotype) and
it corresponding AncMap, and then fill in RefSeq as the parent sequence of
each child sequence.

  Tdata = mapData2AncMap(Tdata, VDJheader, AncMap)

  INPUT
    Tdata: main BRILIA data cell, but selecting for only sequences that
      belong in the same crude cluster (see clusterGene.m) and have the
      same sequence lengths (padtrimSeqGroup.m).
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    AncMap: Ancestrap map matrix (calcAncMap.m or calcRootedAncMap.m)

  OUTPUT
    Tdata: modified Tdata where the RefSeq is the parent sequence of each
      child sequence. 

  NOTE
    The RefSeq in INPUT Tdata for the 1st row should be germline RefSeqs.
    
    The RefSeq of the 1st row of Tdata is not touched, along with any
      AncMap(j, 2) = 0, which is the germline parent 0.
