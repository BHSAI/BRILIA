generateSHMseq will introduce SHM per each sequence clonal group. If the
input contains grouped sequences, will randomly select one sequence and
generate AddSize number of linear descendants. Hence, running
generateSHMseq on the same VDJdata will create branched lineages.

  VDJdata = generateSHMseq(VDJdata,VDJheader,SHMperc,AddSiz,AllowRepeatMut)

  INPUT
    SHMperc: % of nts that must undergo SHM in order to save that seq
    BranchLength: # of seq to add linearly per branch and per group.
    BranchCount: # of lineage branches to add per group.
    AllowRepeatMut ['y' or 'n']: Allows SHM to occur in the same location
       as a previous SHM.

  OUTPUT
    Tdata: cell matrix containing VDJ seq AND descendant seq added.

  NOTE
    VDJdata will be expanded by (AddSize * CloneCount) entries, where
    CloneCount is the number of unique clusters in VDJdata. CloneCount
    does not have to be specified, as it is determined via unique GrpNum
    in VDJdata.
