makeDiagonalSeq will create a character matrix of Seq2 that spans the
width of Seq1, such that Diag1 and Diag2 can be compared directly to
determine alignment. This avoids the iterative sequence checking if one
were to actually move Seq1 across Seq2 for matches.

  [Diag1, Diag2, GoodIdx] = makeDiagonalSeq(SeqA,SeqB)

  INPUT:
    SeqA: Sequence of letters
    SeqB: Sequecne of letters

  OUTPUT
    Diag1: Repeated char matrix of SeqA
    Diag2: Char matrix of SeqB but shifted 1 nt per row.
    GoodIdx: MxN logical matrix indiciating which nt matches should be
      counted towards the score. Used mainly if you don't want edges to
      be counted towards the scoring function.
