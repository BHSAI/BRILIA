getOpenGCF will get a current figure handle ONLY if there is one open.
Otherwise, will return an empty matrix. Better than simple 'gcf' which
will create a figure if there is none.

  Gx = getOpenGCF

  Gx = getOpenGCF(Ax)

  Gx = getOpenGCF(Gx)

  Gx = getOpenGCF('all')

  [Gx, varargout] = getOpenGCA(varargin{:})

  INPUT
    Ax: axes handle to which to determine the figure handle
    Gx: figure handle  (just passes argument to output)
    'all': will get all open figures, and not just the current one.
    varargin: 1xM cell of inputs, in which this function checks if the
      first one is a graphics handle or 'all'.

  OUTPUT
    Gx: figure handle(s) that is (are) open or parent of axes handle
    varargout: varargin in which IF the first input is a handle,
      THEN it will remove it and return varargin of size 1x(M-1).
