mapDotColor_CDR3 will assign a RGB color each CDR3seq based on the
input RefCDR3 order. Used mainly by plotTree.m.

  [DotColor, UnqDotColor] = mapDotColor_CDR3(CDR3seq, UnqCDR3seq)

  [DotColor, UnqDotColor] = mapDotColor_CDR3(..., 'ColorMap', ColorMap)

  INPUT
    CDR3seq: Nx1 cell of CDR3 sequences to be labeled. CDR3seq that is not
      in UnqCDR3seq will return a DotColor of [0 0 0].
    UnqCDR3seq: Mx1 cell containing unique CDR3 sequences, ordered the
      same way as CDR3legend output from makeTreeLegend_CDR3.m. If user
      explicity uses UnqCDR3seq = [], then this will determine the default
      UnqCDR3seq returned by makeTreeLegend_CDR3.m.
    ColorMap: Qx3 matrix containing the RGB colormap that the user wants
      to use. Default is ColorMap = jet;

  OUTPUT
    DotColor: Nx3 matrix storing RGB data for each of CDR3seq
    UnqDotColor: Mx3 matrix strong RGB data for each of UnqCDR3seq
