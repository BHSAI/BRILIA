addIMGTgaps will get a V gene sequence and remove gaps. Will return a
string data that can be used to get the gaps back.

  Seq = addIMGTgaps(NoGapSeq, GapInfo)

  Seq = addIMGTgaps(NoGapSeq, GapInfo, MissingLeft)

  INPUT
    NoGapSeq: nt sequence without gaps, but doesn't have to be the same
      length as the database sequence, as long as the missing left length
      is specfied and there are not extra 5' nts longer than the database
      sequence.
    GapInfo: A string sequence in the format M(-G(M(-G, where +M numbers
      are nt counts, and -G numbers are gap counts. This MUST come from
      the database map structure, DB.(Xmap){j, M.GapInfoLoc}. 
      count. This is used to return a NoGapSeq to a GappedSeq
    MissingLeft: number of nt missing 5' side of the NoGapSeq with respect
      to the database sequence without gaps. This is used if you have an
      incomplete V gene starting. EX: if NoGapSeq starts at the 100th nt
      of the total V gene, then MissingLeft should be 99.

  OUTPUT
    Seq: nt sequence with IMGT "." gaps inserted according to GapInfo

  EXAMPLE
    NoGapSeq = 'caggttactgaatctgcactcac';
    GapInfo = '3#-3#3#-3#3#-3#9#-3#5';
    Seq = addIMGTgaps(NoGapSeq, GapInfo, 0);
    Seq = 
          cag...gtt...act...gaatctgca...ctcac
