countSeqLetter will take a vector of NT or AA sequences, and then count
how many letters are there per position. Returns either a 20xN amino acid
array (21st is ambiguous or special), or a 4xN nt array. Unique characters
are ignored by default.

  [Freq, Letter] = countSeqletter(Seq)

  [Freq, Letter] = countSeqletter(Seq, Alphabet)

  INPUT
    Seq: Nx1 cell array or NxM char array of sequences.
    Alphabet: 'NT' or 'AA' specifies which type of sequences to be used.
   
  OUTPUT
    Freq: 4xM or 20xM matrix counting the frequence of each nucleotide.
      Ignores ambiguous characters.
    Letter: 4x1 or 20x1 cell listing the order of the NT or AA letter
      returned by countSeqLetter.

  EXAMPLE
    Seq = {'ACGUGACGTG';
           'CCGUGAAGTT';
           'TCCUGAAGTT'};
    [Freq, Letter] = countSeqLetter(Seq)
     Freq =
        1   0   0   0   0   3   2   0   0   0
        1   3   1   0   0   0   1   0   0   0
        0   0   2   0   3   0   0   3   0   1
        1   0   0   3   0   0   0   0   3   2
     Letter = 
       'A'
       'C'
       'G'
       'T'
