fixGeneIndel will correct the V gene inserstion/deletion (indel) error as
produced by the sequencing platform error. Will NOT do D and J indel
corrections since they are generally too short to be certain. 

  VDJdata = fixGeneIndel(VDJdata, VDJheader, DB)

  [VDJdata, BadIdx] = fixGeneIndel(...)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    DB: Gene database structure (getCurrentDatabase.m)

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata where nt insertion and deletion in the V
      genes are corrected for. 

  NOTE
    This code DOES NOT fix indel error that are >= 2 consecutive nts long, 
      because this could signifiy an alignment error as opposed to an
      indel error. Also, V and J gene indels are not corrected for.

    In order for indel correction to trigger, it must detect V alignments
      that either:
        1) shows a germline V gene deletion that goes beyond the conserved
           C residue, OR
        2) has a 20% miss rate in the V alignment caused by indel-induced
           frame shift error
