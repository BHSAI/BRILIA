fixInputSeq will check all input sequences within VDJdata to ensure it
meets the minimum quality for BRILIA processing. Returns a logical index
array called BadIdx that can be used to delete the bad sequences, which
are those with > 10% of sequence with non-nucleotide letters.

  VDJdata = fixInputSeq(VDJdata, VDJheader)

  [VDJdata, BadIdx] = fixInputSeq(VDJdata, VDJheader)

  [VDJdata, BadIdx] = fixInputSeq(VDJdata, VDJheader, MaxErrPerc)

  INPUT
    VDJdata: main BRILIA data cell
    VDJheader: main BRILIA header cell
    MaxErrRate: max fraction of nts in seq that is tolerable (0.1 default)

  OUTPUT
    VDJdata: modified VDJdata with corrected sequences
    BadIdx: Nx1 logical array of entries have > 10% non-nt letters
