getOpenGCA will get a current axes handle ONLY if there is one open.
Otherwise, will return an empty matrix. Better than simple 'gca' which
will create a figure and axes if there is none.

  Ax = getOpenGCA

  Ax = getOpenGCA(Ax)

  Ax = getOpenGCA(Gx)

  Ax = getOpenGCA('all')

  [Ax, varargout] = getOpenGCA(varargin{:})

  INPUT
    Gx: figure handle to which to get all the children axes handle
    Ax: axes handle (just passes argument to output)
    'all': will get all open axes on all figures.
    varargin: 1xM cell of inputs, in which this function checks if the
      first one is a graphics handle or 'all'.

  OUTPUT
    Ax: Axes handle(s) that is (are) open or 1st child of figure handle
    varargout: varargin in which IF the first input is a handle,
      THEN it will remove it and return varargin of size 1x(M-1).
