findHotSpots will classify the mutation and the surrounding BPs to
identify if there are any hotspots associated with a point mutation.

  WRCY
  RGYW 
  W = A or T
  R = A or G
  Y = T or C
This will look for a NT, then look +- 2 nts afrom the nucleotide and build
a compositional matrix. It will also produce an 2nd matrix to find
compositional variation for any C, which is used to determine the degree
of extra selection power for a hot spot.
